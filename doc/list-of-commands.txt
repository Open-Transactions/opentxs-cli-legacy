Testing:

Full program build:
	./full-rebuild.sh
Build after change:
	make

#### Setup testing environment:

Start with debug redirected to file
	./start-log-shell.sh
Start server in second console:
	otserver
View debug in third console:
	tail -f debuglog.txt

#### Testing command:

1. Check if implemented command works as described in documentation:
	doc/commands-tree.txt
2. Check if all possible variation of command are described in documentation:
	doc/commands-tree.txt
3. Check if command are properly described in file:
	doc/commands-tree.odg
4. Check if command is properly described in output of command:
