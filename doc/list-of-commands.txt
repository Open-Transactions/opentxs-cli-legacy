Testing:

Full program build:
	./full-rebuild.sh
Build after change:
	make

#### Setup testing environment:

Start with debug redirected to file
	./start-log-shell.sh
Start server in second console:
	otserver
View debug in third console:
	tail -f debuglog.txt

#### Testing command:

1. Check if implemented command works as described in documentation:
	doc/commands-tree.txt
2. Check if all possible variation of command are described in documentation:
	doc/commands-tree.txt
3. Check if command are properly described in file:
	doc/commands-tree.odg
4. Check if command is properly described in output of command:
	ot help cmd <command>
5. Check if proper validation functionality exists and works for command variables
6. Check if proper hinting functionality exists and works for command variables

8. If there are commands that creates, add, refresh, remove, rename: account, asset, nym, server try to check commands completion, hinting and execution after calling them

#### If:
* Program behave differently that described in documentation
* There are errors in documentation
