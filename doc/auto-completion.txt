Description of auto completion

=== Introduction ===

First an advance example of magic of OT hints:
	ot msg send bob al<TAB>
will auto-complete options:
	alice alex alcapone
In this situation, bash autocomplete with othint program
will query the OT server to list your contacts named al...

With respecting your privacy, trying to use remote server only if
data was not cached, and only asking servers that you trust (the --HT option)
that is the default. Start with "ot --H0" to make sure there will be 0 network
activity, no servers will be asked:
	ot --H0 msg send bob a<TAB>
will auto-complete with data that can be given without causing network traffic.

ot_secure:
If it's more convinient, we might provide separate command: "ot_net", "ot_secure"
with other level of discretion in the hinting process as well with say more
confirmations when also EXECUTING a command that will connect to OT server.
	ot_quiet mint spawn bob silve<TAB>
	1. will NOT ask any server about the list of currenies silve... will use cache
		silvergrams silvertest silverbob {showing only cached data, last update 3h ago}
	2. when the command is finished and executed as
		ot_quiet mint spawn bob silvergrams 1000<ENTER>
	it will ask: "Please confirm do you want to connect NOW to OT server aliased BigTest1,
	with ID=855gusd2dffj2d9uisdfokj233 (unknown/new server), and execute
	mint-spawn command? Type 2 words: 'unknown spawn' to confirm, or 'no'"

Also name alice is in front (instead alphabet sorting) since it was recently/frequently used.

All OT commands will be neatly supported in this way.


=== Commands are in form ===

ot [front1,front2...] topic action   	var1,...  [varM,...] [--optNameN[=[optArgN]]...]

ot <-front options--> <- cCmdname --> <---- arguments ------------------------------->
ot                    <- cmd name --> <---- vars -----> <-- options ----------------->
ot <--- optional ---> <- mandatory--> <--- optional ------------------------>
ot <-- cmdFrontOpt -> <- cmdPart ---> <-------------- cmdArgs ----------------------->

Examples:
ot  --H0              msg   send              bob a
ot                    msg   send              bob alice            --attach scan.jpeg
ot                    msg   send              bob alice carol      --attach scan.jpeg
ot                    msg   send              bob alice carol      -v -v -v
ot  --hint-private    msg   send              bob alice carol      -v -v -v
ot  --hint-cached     msg   send              bob alice carol      -v -v -v
ot  --hint-cached     msg   help

Examples of SYNTAX ERRORS:
ot                    msg                     bob  alice # missing subcommand
ot                    msg   send              bob  # requires at least 2 arguments(*)
ot                    msg   send              bob  alice           --date=now --date=0 # date is unique
ot                    msg   send              bob  --hint-cachead=0 # forward command must be in font

(*) possibly such errors will instead allow execution and have the program interactivly ask for missing mandatory vars.

Therefore the syntax is:
[front-options] 2 words of command name, 0..N mandatory variables, 0..M extra variables, any options

	- subaction will be probably not used but leaving such possibility, then it would be 2..3 words

ARGUMENTS:
	- front-options are special options that must appear in front because they change meaning/parsing
		of everything next - particullary, auto-completion options. Read section [front-options] for details

	- Arguments available depend on the command name.

	- Options for command depend on the command name, as well are imported from global.

	- Options can't be placed before variables!

	- Options can be unique or can repeat. Options can have no value/data,
		or can have one.This gives 2*2 = 4 kinds of options: uniq, uniqData,
		repeat, repeatData.

	- Options can be both global and comming from selected action/subaction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[front-options] usage is for example:
If you type -HN in front of options, then Hints will use Network (-HN) to autocomplete, typing
ot -HN msg send myuser1 bo<TAB> will e.g. ask OT server(s) (e.g. over internet) about you address book
ot -HT msg send myuser1 bo<TAB> the same but for Trusted servers only (will not accidentially talk to other servers)
ot -H0 .... will make sure you will not ask OT servers, just use data cached
ot -HR .... will force othint to refresh all information from servers. Option useful if you want fresh information from servers in real time. Slow and dagerous for privacy.

The exact planned options are 2 settings: accessing remote and accessing cache.
	--hint-remote=V set's the privacy to level 0..9. 0=never ask remote severs for data needed for
	this autocompletion, 9 freely ask (less secure, because remote server see that we compose a command).
	1=local server (e.g. localhost that was marked as trusted)
	3=trusted servers (e.g. several servers you configure as trusted)
	5=uses network (all servers) but might avoid some really sensive data
	9=you fully ask the server owners and consent to possiblity of them (or their ISP, hosting) learning
	what you are planning to do

	--hint-cached=V set's the usage of cached data. 0=revalidate now all data from server.
	5=normal reasonable use of cache
	8=only cached data, unless we have no choice, 9=only cached data even if it causes an error

--hint-remote=0 implies --hint-cached=9 as we are not allowed to touch remote server at all
--hint-cached=0 implied --hints-remote=0 as we are ordering to touch remote server so we are not working in private mode

--hint-remote=0 --hint-cached=0 is disallowed syntax,
even though some commands that indeed do not need neither cached nor remote data could work,
like "ot --hint-remote=0 --hint-cached=0 msg help"
or "ot --hint-remote=0 --hint-cached=0 msg draft"
but for clarity it will be an error because likelly someone confused the options.
But then, --hint-allow-strange option will allow such syntax, if it appears in front of option causing this
contradiction.
E.g. this is allowed syntax:
ot --hint-allow-strange --hint-remote=0 --hint-cached=0 msg draft

Shortcuts:
--H0 gives hints offline        equals --hint-offline     equals --hint-remote=0 --hint-cached=9
--HL gives hints local          equals --hint-local       equals --hint-remote=1 --hint-cached=5
--HT gives hints trusted        equals --hint-trusted     equals --hint-remote=3 --hint-cached=5
--HN gives hints from network   equals --hint-net         equals --hint-remote=5 --hint-cached=5
--HR is forced net reload       equals --hint-reload      equals --hint-remote=9 --hint-cached=0
--HV gives VPNed network        equals --hint-vpn         equals --vpn-all-net --hint-remote=9 --hint-cached=5

VPN:
option --vpn-all-net will force hint autocompletion (and also the actuall commands, unless later
canceled with other options) to use only VPN or similar secure networking. Details will be
configured, it could be e.g. a VPN network, or possibly other secured (private) network facility.
It is guarnateed that if such secure network fails to work, then no network will be touched
and program will not leak any activity to open network (LAN, Internet, etc)
--HV might be most comfortable and yet quite secure option, usable e.g. from hotels.

VPN forced:
Global configuration option could force to always use VPN (append --vpn-all-net)
then use "ot --HN" will not auto-complete on <TAB> but show:
	{can not use --HN because your configuration disabled it, please try --HV}
and if executed as full command, will also refuse to work, with explanation.

Please remember that VPNs or even more advanced solutions are not that secure, and that
ot hint sends anyway lots of data of intended action, with timing correlation, to the OT server
in --HV case.
VPN only hides your IP a bit.
Full caching with --H0 or --HL is most secure, there is no home like localhost :)
